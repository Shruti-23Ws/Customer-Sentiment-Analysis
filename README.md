📊 iPhone 15 Customer Review Analysis Dashboard (Flipkart)
1. 📝 Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback for the iPhone 15 (128GB) model collected from Flipkart. By leveraging Python-based web scraping, text analysis, and data visualization, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of user sentiment, product ratings, and overall customer satisfaction.

2. ❓ Business Problem
With thousands of reviews posted by customers on Flipkart, it's challenging for Apple and sellers to manually interpret and act upon feedback. Understanding customer pain points and praise areas is essential for improving product marketing, service quality, and user experience. Manual review is inefficient, prone to bias, and not scalable.
